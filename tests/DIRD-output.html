<h1>Debug Suggestions</h1>
<p>Overall, the provided code is a simple program that adds two numbers and displays the sum. It is clear and concise, and adheres to the best practice of using meaningful variable names.

However, there are a few potential bugs and areas for improvement in the code:

1. Floating point precision: In Python, floating point numbers can sometimes result in precision issues due to the way they are stored. It is better to use the Decimal module for precise decimal arithmetic. In this case, since the numbers provided are simple, the floating point precision issue can be ignored. But if higher precision is required, using the Decimal module would be beneficial.

2. Magic numbers: The initial values of `num1` and `num2` are hard-coded directly into the program. It would be better to either provide these values through user input or as command-line arguments. This would make the code more flexible and reusable.

3. Inefficient string formatting: The `print` statement uses the `.format()` method for string formatting. While this is a valid approach, it is more efficient to use f-strings in Python 3.6 and above. Using f-strings make the code more readable and reduces the chances of making formatting mistakes.

Taking these points into consideration, here is the improved version of the code:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

def add_numbers(num1, num2):
    return num1 + num2

# Get user input for the numbers
num1 = Decimal(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = Decimal(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Add two numbers
sum = add_numbers(num1, num2)

# Display the sum
print(f'The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum}')
```

In this updated code, the precision issue is addressed by using the Decimal module for precise decimal arithmetic. The program now prompts the user to enter the numbers, making the code more flexible and reusable. The `add_numbers()` function is introduced to encapsulate the addition logic, which can be useful if the program needs to be expanded in the future. Finally, f-strings are used for efficient string formatting.</p>
