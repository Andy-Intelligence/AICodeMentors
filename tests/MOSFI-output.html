This diff consists of removing the previous code and replacing it with a new function called "sumr" that takes two parameters "a" and "b".

Code Review:
- The function name "sumr" is not self-explanatory. Consider using a more descriptive name to convey the purpose of the function.
- The parameters "a" and "b" should have more meaningful names to enhance code readability.
- The code lacks comments or any form of documentation to explain the behavior or purpose of the function.
- The code does not handle any potential errors or validate the input parameters.
- No test cases or examples are provided to demonstrate the expected output or usage of the function.
- The code formatting and structure seem fine.

Score: 65/100

The developer successfully implemented a new function, but there are several areas for improvement. The function name and parameter names could be more descriptive for better understanding. The lack of comments or documentation makes it harder to comprehend the code's purpose. Additionally, error handling, input validation, and test cases are missing. With these improvements, the code's quality and maintainability would be significantly enhanced.</pre>
